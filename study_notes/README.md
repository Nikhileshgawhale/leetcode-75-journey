## üéØ Problem Selection Strategy

### Daily Practice
- **Easy:** 1-2 problems per day
- **Medium:** 1 problem per day
- **Hard:** 1 problem every 2-3 days

### Topic Rotation
- **Week 1:** Arrays & Strings
- **Week 2:** Stack & Queue
- **Week 3:** Linked Lists
- **Week 4:** Trees & Graphs
- **Week 5:** Binary Search
- **Week 6:** Dynamic Programming
- **Week 7:** Review & Mixed topics
- **Week 8:** Advanced topics

## üìù Study Techniques

### 1. Active Learning
- **Implement solutions** from scratch
- **Draw diagrams** for complex problems
- **Explain solutions** to others (or yourself)

### 2. Spaced Repetition
- **Review solved problems** after 1, 3, 7, 14 days
- **Re-implement solutions** from memory
- **Focus on patterns** rather than memorization

### 3. Problem Analysis
- **Read the problem** carefully (2-3 times)
- **Identify the pattern** or technique needed
- **Consider edge cases** before coding
- **Estimate time/space complexity**

### 4. Code Quality
- **Write clean, readable code**
- **Add meaningful comments**
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Handle edge cases properly**

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Weekly Goals
- [ ] Solve 7 problems (1 per day)
- [ ] Cover 2-3 different topics
- [ ] Review 3 previously solved problems
- [ ] Update progress tracker

### Monthly Goals
- [ ] Solve 30 problems
- [ ] Master 1 new topic completely
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ success rate on easy problems
- [ ] Achieve 60%+ success rate on medium problems

## üí° Tips for Success

### Time Management
- **Set aside 1-2 hours** daily for practice
- **Use pomodoro technique** (25 min work, 5 min break)
- **Track your time** spent on each problem

### Problem Solving Approach
1. **Understand** the problem completely
2. **Plan** your approach (pseudocode)
3. **Implement** the solution
4. **Test** with examples and edge cases
5. **Optimize** if needed
6. **Document** your solution

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Rushing to code** without understanding
- **Ignoring edge cases**
- **Not considering time/space complexity**
- **Copying solutions** without understanding
- **Skipping the review phase**
